# Yakka

**Yakka** is a Chess Engine written in object pascal (Delphi) that implements the Universal Chess Interface (UCI) protocol.

## Target Platform

  - Windows 11 x64 Platform
  - Command-line, Console Application
  - Written in Delphi Object Pascal
  - Will run on x86-64 CPU's which support BMI2 and AVX2 instruction set

## How To Use

**Yakka** implements the Universal Chess Interface (UCI) protocol that is compatible with most popular Chess GUIs. 
  
It is recommended to use a Chess GUI application such as [Arena](http://www.playwitharena.de/), [BanksiaGUI](https://banksiagui.com/) or [Cute Chess](https://cutechess.com/).
  
Alternatively Yakka can be run as a command line console using UCI commands.

## Implemented Engine Options (UCI)

  - option name Threads type spin default 1 min 1 max 16
  - option name Hash type spin default 64 min 1 max 256
  - option name Clear Hash type button
  - option name Ponder type check default false
  - option name OwnBook type check default false  
  - option name UCI_EngineAbout type string  

## Download

You can download the precompiled Windows executable : 'Yakka v1.3 x64.exe'
This will run on x86-64 CPU's which support the BMI2 and AVX2 instruction sets.  

## Compilation

To build the engine from source, use Delphi 12.0 Alexandra or later version.

  - Import the source files from GitHub repository
  - Set Target Platform to Windows 64-bit
  - Open Project Resources and Images..., add the following to Resource Files:  
  
	  - File Name : 'Opening_Book_00.txt'
	  - Type : RCDATA
	  - Identifier : Open_Book  
			  
	  - File Name : 'NNUE 768x128_x2 151190269c +70+ gen5.net'
	  - Type : RCDATA
	  - Identifier : \_768x128\_x2\_gen5
		
  - Build 'Yakka'
